            selected 18 research articles to analyze what previous researchers did. We reduced the number of articles to
            12 because some of them are not relevant to our topic. Our research proposes an AI-based tool for content
            analysis during crises. We hope to identify misinformation and emotions behind content.
            Following are the previous researches and their methods and findings. </p>

            not been investigated. Food photos on social media are generally intended to be visually appealing. This has
            created the ‘Instagrammable’ culture with photos on social media are that must look pretty and be enviable
            images. Information sharing on social media allows users to control what they share. The content created can
            be an extension of themselves and provide a sense of belonging. Social media use allows people to establish

            Data is rapidly produced and occupies a large space in systems that have resulted in enormous data

            extracting and adapting knowledge from data sets. The idea and method of text mining are one of the fields
            that seek to extract useful information from unstructured textual data used today. Deep learning has emerged
            as a powerful machine learning technique that learns multiple layers of representations or features of the
